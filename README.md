# Farm Help

A platform crafted to support a critical industry: Agriculture.

Given the rapid advancements in technology and the ever-expanding reach of the internet, it is highly probable that farmers will increasingly adopt technology to amplify their productivity and leverage the finest resources at their disposal.
Our goal is to establish a resource hub where farmers can submit images of their crops, and in return, receive assessments on their crops' health status, along with identification of potential plant diseases, accompanied by viable and practical solutions.
